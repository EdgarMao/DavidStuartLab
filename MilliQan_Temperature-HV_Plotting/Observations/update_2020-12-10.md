[not very useful]


**Thoughts about next steps:**

The same technique of making linear fits can be used in evaluating prepulse data dependence. With slight modification to the code for dataplot_HV-temp_scatter.py, I can create linear (or potentially higher order) fits for temperature in relationship to amount of single photons in prepulse. With enough data, the linear fit can be used as a good reference for finding the dark count rate of the system.

Ultimately, I think we are looking at achieveing some kind of statistical result that tells the estimated dark count rate at different HV-settings. However, I am not very sure what kind of thermodynamic problem am I looking at. I am uncertain if the approach of developing linear fit is the most accurate way to decribe the dependence.
