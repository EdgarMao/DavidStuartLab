There are no major new observations in these cleaned up plots, the linear fits will provide further insights on the temperature dependence with high voltage.


**Scatter Plots with linear fit:**

[Not ready yet]

**Thoughts about next steps:**

The linear fit demonstrates a statistical dependence between the temperature and the HV settings, the next step should be to observe if there is some kind of statistical dependence between HV setting and the prepulse of different runs. Eventually the expectation is to connect those dependence and have a general idea about the relationship between temperature and fluctuations in prepulse, which will provide a reliable estimation of the dark counts.
