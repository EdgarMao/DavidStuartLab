**2020 Winter Quarter Research Summary**

In this quarter, the general goal for my research project is to gain qualitative understanding of the dark count rate of MilliQan sensor through data processing programs. My plan to achieve this goal mainly involved three steps: 

First, refine and document the programs I developed in the previous school year, and use my previous temperature data plotting program as the foundation of a new program. 

Then, develop a plotting program that graphically demonstrates my previously drawn qualitative conclusion on the dependence between temperature and high voltage setting of the sensor. 

Lastly, use the plots produced by this program to find runs where a strong dependence between HV setting and temperature is demonstrated, and use the prepulse data provided by Elliot to check if there is a dependence between temperature and the single photon counts in the prepulse, a dependence here would suggest potential presence of dark counts in single photons detected by MilliQan.

So far, I have fully completed the first two steps, and I am waiting for the prepulse data of the chosen runs to get fully processed to finish up my third step and draw a vaild conclusion. While completing my finals and waiting for the data to finish processing, I have made a more comprehensive list of runs with clear temperature and high voltage dependence. However, the primary goal right now is to study several representative runs and check if dark counts exist in MilliQan's single photon data.
